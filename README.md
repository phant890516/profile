The landing page is built with Unicorn Studio, which focuses on immersive 3D visual effects.
I customized the generated 3D effects and adapted them into the core concept design of this website, creating a visually engaging and interactive first impression.

## 🧷 GSAP Navigation

The navigation is implemented using GSAP, an industry-recognized animation library used on over 11 million websites.
It provides smooth, responsive animations that adapt dynamically to changes in screen size and user interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.
